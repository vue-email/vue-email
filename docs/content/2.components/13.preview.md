Email clients have this concept of “preview text” which gives insight into what’s inside the email before you open. A good practice is to keep that text under 90 characters.
::


## Usage
Add the component to your email template. Include styles where needed.

```vue
<template>
  <e-preview>Email preview text</e-preview>
</template>

<script setup>
import { EPreview } from 'vue-email';
</script>
```
